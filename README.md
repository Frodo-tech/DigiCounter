Very simple and basic Memory Counter for the Digimon Card Game to use for tabletop play and also available for PC to use with OBS setups for Online Webcam games.


Made with Godot and FOSS because Ads are annoying.

Controls:

-Touch or Click numbers to move the memory indicator.
-For PC/Keyboard only: use Arrow Keys to move memory indicator by 1 space.

Known Issues:
-Android version needs to be recompiled but essentially usable, PC is up to date.
-PC/Keyboard: when alternaning between Touch/Click and Keyboard inputs position is not updated internally so next time Keyboard inputs are used, memory counter will move from the last number from which Keyboard inputs where used. (i.e: if you start at 0, press right to go -1, click +10, then press right again, counter will move to -2).
